# Recipes
A github repository for learning how to construct webpages. The construction of this website follows from the odin project's foundations course. 
The goal of this webpage is to demonstrate basic knowledge of html including setup, highlighting via bolding and italics, ordered and unordered lists, 
paragraphs, headings, images, and absolute and relative links.
