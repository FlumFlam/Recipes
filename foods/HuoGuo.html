        <h2>What is Hot Pot?</h3>
        <p>
            If you’re new to hot pot, it’s a really low stress way to have a fun and festive meal with people you love. On this particular weekend, we’re celebrating my birthday, but hot pot needs no excuses to be enjoyed on any day of the year. 
            At its core, hot pot is a social experience where you cook raw foods in a communal pot of flavored broth or soup. It has many variations across almost every Asian country, and a handful of European ones as well. 
            In China, the tradition of hot pot dates back thousands of years, and even just within Chinese cuisine, there are a ton of regional varieties on hot pot, ranging from the world famous spicy Sichuan style to the more grounding Guangdong flavors that my dad prefers. 
            Almost all Chinese hot pot meals entail preparing a variety of meats, vegetables, and starches.
